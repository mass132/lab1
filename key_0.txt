Java Quiz key

1. a
str[i] is String type array, cannot assign int to it.

2. b
overriding and overloading ensures multiple behaviour, thus implementing polymorphism


3. a
In the expression c=a+b, a and b are converted to int. Casting can solve the issue: c=(short)(a+b);

4. a
Checked exception IOException must be declared to be thrown in m1()
 public void m1() throws IOException


5. d
static blocks are executed first.

6. b
int sum(int first, int second) { return first + second; }
('a' doesn't have return statement, 'c' has no type declaration for second, 'd' has no method return type)

7. b
start() cannot be called second time as the thread is already in running state.

8. d
Set does not allow multiples. 'A' cannot be added second time and add() method returns false.

9. c
ArrayList expands automatically to fit the addition

10. d
main thread waits till thread t is dead when t.join() is called, therby allowing data to be assigned 10 after 2 seconds

11. b
In case of short circuit operators && and || if the first expression alone can determine a condition, then the second is not checked. Here, in cases 'a' and 'c' the second expression is not verified

12. c
'<' and '>' have higher precedence to '&' and '|' so 5 & 7 and 5 | 7 should be enclosed in parenthesis. All operators are checked by compiler.

13. b
Compile error. Checked exception IOException is never thrown in try block, so cannot be caught.

14. a
Exception should be declared to be thrown in the default Constructor in inherited class: public Child() throws Exception {}

15. b
Cannot access instance variable age from static method main.

16. a
Will not compile : local variable y has to be initialised before using it.
Replace if(x >= 10)   y = 2; with else y=2; and it will compile

17. d
Thread()  and Thread(Runnable r, String name) are valid constructors

18. d
squarecircle... There is no else statement

19. a
The default constructor initializes the instance variables declared in the class, the compiler does not create a default constructor if we define a constructor with parameters.

20. c
Autoboxing will take care of type Integer to int casting

21. b
First constructor of super is called and then child

22. a
; i < 5; i++ : is correct because i is already declared and initialized
int j: arr : is the construct for foreach loop

23. b
big city. String is immutable.

24. a
m[0,7][1,7]5. There is no error in code.

25. a
Only public static void main(String... args) is correct main method

26. d
having same parameter but different return type does not make overloading. 

27. d
y=x in change() method does not affect 'a' and 'b' in main

28. a
Java can be used as stand alone application
Java cannot be compiled to get an OS executable file

29. b
s3 and s4 belong to String pool and share the same object

30. c
A two dimensional array is an array of arrays

31. a
wait() should be used in synchronized block, else IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown

32. c
The access modifier to member data is private, methods provide for access and modification of data.

33. a
Hashtable implements java.util.Map

34. d
Object array1[]; and int[] array3; are correct

35. a
A and B are keywords. D is 'a' minus 'class'.

36. d
All of them are TRUE

37. c
Others have loss of precision

38. c
"a" and "cafe" are String, 'cafe' is wrong, true cannot be char

39. d
TreeSet implements SortedSet interface, and so elements are sorted and no duplicates

40. c
++x increments before usage and x++ uses first and then increments
